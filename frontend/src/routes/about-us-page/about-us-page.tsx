      <h2 class="text-3xl text-primary font-bold mb-8">Our Motivation:</h2>

      <p class="mb-5">
        Lottopool was born from the belief that our unique idea has the potential to become
        something more than just a college project. We were inspired to create a platform that not
        only challenges our skills but also tests our ability to communicate effectively with one
        another.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        After researching existing lottery pooling platforms, we found that while a few have had
        some success, they never managed to gain attention. We believe that Lottopool can change
        this by bringing a fresh and innovative approach to the lottery pooling space.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-8">
        Join us on this exciting journey as we strive to make Lottopool a reality and revolutionize
        the way people participate in lotteries. Together, let's dream big and win even bigger!
